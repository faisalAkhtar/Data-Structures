1. Write a program to search an element from a list. Give user the option to perform Linear or
Binary search. Use Template functions.
	<br>
2. WAP using templates to sort a list of elements. Give user the option to perform sorting using
Insertion sort, Bubble sort or Selection sort.
	<br>
3. Implement Linked List using templates. Include functions for insertion, deletion and search of
a number, reverse the list and concatenate two linked lists (include a function and also overload
operator +).
	<br>
4. Implement Doubly Linked List using templates. Include functions for insertion, deletion and
search of a number, reverse the list.
	<br>
5. Implement Circular Linked List using templates. Include functions for insertion, deletion and
search of a number, reverse the list.
	<br>
6. Perform Stack operations using Linked List implementation.
	<br>
7. Perform Stack operations using Array implementation. Use Templates.
	<br>
8. Perform Queues operations using Circular Array implementation. Use Templates.
	<br>
9. Create and perform different operations on Double-ended Queues using Linked List
implementation.
	<br>
10. WAP to scan a polynomial using linked list and add two polynomial.
